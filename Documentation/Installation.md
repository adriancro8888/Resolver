#  Resolver: Installation

## Not yet Implemented

The plan is for Resolver to be Carthage, Cocoapods, and Swift Framework compliant.

That's the plan. For now, however, just checkout the project and add `Resolver.swift` to your project's Third Party Software folder.

Add `ResolverStoryboard.swift` for optional Storyboard support.

That's it. Two files and you're done.
