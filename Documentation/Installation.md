#  Resolver: Installation

## CocoaPods

Resolver is available through CocoaPods. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "Resolver"
```

Special thanks to [Khoa Pham](https://github.com/onmyway133) for making the *Resolver* repo available on CocoaPods.

### Carthage / Swift Frameworks

The plan is for Resolver to be Carthage and Swift Framework compliant.

That's the plan. For now, however, just checkout the project and add `Resolver.swift` to your project's Third Party Software folder.

That's it. One file and you're done.

Hmmmm... maybe I don't need framework support after all.
