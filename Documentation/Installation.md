#  Resolver: Installation

## Not yet Implemented

The plan is for Resolver to be Carthage, Cocoapods, and Swift Framework compliant.

That's the plan. For now, however, just checkout the project and add `Resolver.swift` to your project's Third Party Software folder.

That's it. One file and you're done.

Hmmmm... maybe I don't need framework support after all.
